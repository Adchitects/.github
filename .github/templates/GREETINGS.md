## Things to remember

1. üí° **Please mark the Pull Request as a `draft` if it is not ready.**\
   In other words, when it still is a work in progress _(WIP)_.\
   List your [TODO] list, so other contributors can help you speed it up.

1. ‚ùó **Any Pull Request title needs to follow our [Git commits messages
   convention].**\
   We're using the _"Squash and merge"_ strategy,
   so **what matters the most to us is the title**.
